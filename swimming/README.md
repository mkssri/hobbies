* don't be like superman putting 2 hands forward.
* try to scoop water when you are moving hands.
* when your legs are sinking, dont raise your head, put your head in water, that way your legs will raise.
* when moving hands forward, lift them up, and move them on surface of water(forward), if you move them forward
  inside the water, then water will push you back. so moving on surface is good option.
