### compare b/w iphone and android

- unlock phone (via face)
  - iphone added feature to show that you are being detected when unlocking an app or unlocking the phone (visual)
  - andriod did not lol so i would not know if phone/app is it getting unlocked or not.

- clock (timer)
  - iphone have added analong sound and scroll in order to set the timer. (so cool, feels like real life)
  - andriod did not do it lol, it feels clicking something when i am setting the timer.
