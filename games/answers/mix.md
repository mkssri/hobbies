- Three. Two ducks are in front of the last duck; the first duck has two ducks behind;
  one duck is between the other two.

- CABDE. Putting the first three in order, A finished in front of B but behind C, so

- Yes. If Anne is married, then she is married and looking at Geroge, who is unmarried. 
  If Annie is unmarried, then Jack, who is married, is looking at her. Either way, the

- Because they both burn inconsistently, you can’t just light one end of a rope and wait 
  until it’s 75 percent of the way through. But, this is what you can do: Light the first 
  rope at both ends, and light the other rope at one end, all at the same time. The first 
  rope will take 30 minutes to burn (even if one side burns faster than the other, it still 
  takes 30 minutes). The moment the first rope goes out, light the other end of the second rope. 
  Because the time elapsed of the second rope burning was 30 minutes, the remaining rope will 
  also take 30 minutes; lighting it from both ends will cut that in half to 15 minutes, giving 
  you 45 minutes all together.
