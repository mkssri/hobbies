- Remember Summer 2022
* It was super tough.
* Noise due to family.
* Noise due to S.
* poor decisions and no planning.
* Did not have comfortable living, that also killed.
* You slept like 2 hrs a day.

* you are only person who will think about you, no one thinks.

* Never live in a living room and screw up things, which you did in summer2022.
