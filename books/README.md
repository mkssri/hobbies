- Clean Code: This book talks about Quality of Code and things to avoid(Ex: Global Variables), it also talks about how many parameters you should have in your function.
- If a function has 20 parameters then something is wrong, since mainly function is doing too much lol.
- For function taking lot of data we can use something like called struct.
- So do not use global data as much as possible, document it well haha :)
- Make sure you understand the code and document the code very very well.

whenever we create a variable and assign some memory to it in C we need manually free the memory 
once we are done using the variable, where as it is automatically memory is freed in languages like java etc.. by something called garbage collector.. yay!!

##### converting strings to numbers
- atof(): A value of type double  is 
- atoi(): converting a string to an int.
